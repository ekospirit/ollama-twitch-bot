# There are three context models to choose from, think of it like chat history. 
# Each context is only stored until the bot is restarted. 
# More information: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-chat-completion
#
# OLLAMA_CONTEXT must be one of those three:
# none: No additional message context is provided to ollama
# general: Each message sent to ollama will be added to a general context store and provided on the next use.
# user: Each user gets their own context from the previous times they used the ()gpt command
OLLAMA_CONTEXT=user

# OLLAMA_SYSTEM provides general instructions to the ai model that it should follow.
# For example Twitch chat messages have a character limit of 500 characters and so on.
# Think of it like options. It doesn't follow them all the time tho, honestly no idea how.
OLLAMA_SYSTEM=You are a Twitch chat bot and interact with users in an irc like environment. Do not use any formatting. Be human-like. Never fail to answer the user. Always answer immediately. Most importantly keep your response shorter than 450 characters.
