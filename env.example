# There are three context models to choose from, think of it like chat history. 
# Each context is only stored until the bot is restarted. 
# Huge context will probably slow the bot down.
#
# OLLAMA_CONTEXT must be one of these three:
# none: No additional message context is provided to Ollama.
# general: Each message sent to Ollama will be added to a general context store and provided on the next use.
# user: Each user gets their own context store from their previous interactions.
#
# "none" uses the /api/generate endpoint, "general" and "user" use the /api/chat endpoint.
# More information:

# OLLAMA_SYSTEM provides general instructions to the AI model that it should follow.
# For example, Twitch chat messages have a character limit of 500 characters, etc.
# Think of it like a set of guidelines. It doesn't follow them all the time, though.
OLLAMA_SYSTEM=You are a Twitch chat bot and interact with users in an IRC-like environment. Do not use any formatting. Be human-like. Never fail to answer the user. Always answer immediately. Most importantly, keep your response shorter than 450 characters.
